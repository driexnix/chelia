# Powershell connection towards clients

When you setup a baseline script, you'd hate it to run the script per client tenant. We need to automate this. 

The start:
{% highlight js %}
Connect-MsolService
{% endhighlight %}

If Connect-MsolService is new to you, please go back to start.
Let's make a variable of all your clients.

{% highlight js %}
$clients = get-msolPartnerContract -all
{% endhighlight %}

Lets run a ForEach loop

{% highlight js %}
ForEach ($client in $clients) {Get-MsolDomain -TenantId $client.TenantId}
{% endhighlight %}

Press <b>Enter</b>

You'll receive a list of all your clients and their domain. 
Great success.
