# Contributer name is wrong.

Working in multiple projects, you might get into an issue with GIT, uploading a wrong name to your github page.
And you really wanna hide your name from all your fanboys. 

> don't be suspicious, don't be suspicious. 

## Remember

You downloaded GIT, open up a shell and check the following.

{% highlight js %} git config --list
{% endhighlight %}

Wall of text and at the bottom you'll find user.name and user.email and my guess is that it shows a wrong name :> ? 

Change accordingly

{% highlight js %} git config --global user.name "Fred"
git config --global user.email "Fred@noreply.com" 
{% endhighlight %}

Validate with config - - list command and you are golden.
